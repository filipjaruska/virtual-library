# After updating from Next 14 to Next 15 / React 19 rc some dependencies will not install without --legacy-peer-deps flag 
# If the build fails with Error: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss' add --include=dev to the install command
# So potentially the install command will look like "npm install --legacy-peer-deps --include=dev"

# Environment variables are validated using @t3-oss/env-nextjs
# Make sure to update src/env.ts if you add new environment variables

# If the production build fails with url build error include https:// before the url
# REQUIRED: Strapi backend URL (must be a valid URL)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL="http://localhost:1337/"

# Setting the NODE_ENV to production might sometimes not always cause the build to fail the fix is to set --include=dev flag in the install command as mentioned above
# OPTIONAL: Node environment (defaults to 'development')
NODE_ENV="production"

# Keep in mind when copying the urls, to make sure they don't end with a /, sometimes not always (as it seems to be the case with everything in react) it might cause some funky errors 
# OPTIONAL: Host for deployment
HOST="vercel.vercel.app"

# OPTIONAL: Skip environment validation during build (useful for Docker builds)
# SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true
